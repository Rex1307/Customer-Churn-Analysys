# Customer-Churn-Analysys

This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecom company dataset. The goal is to identify key factors that influence customer churn and provide data-driven business recommendations to improve customer retention.

📌 Project Overview

-> Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. This project analyzes customer behavior to identify the key factors influencing churn and provides actionable business recommendations to improve retention.

-> Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), we examine how contract type, payment method, tenure, internet service, and demographic features impact customer churn.

🎯 Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

1.) Identify high-risk customers likely to churn
2.) Analyze churn trends across contracts, tenure, and payment methods
3.) Discover patterns using percentage-based insights
4.)Provide data-driven business recommendations

🗂 Dataset Information

->Dataset: Telecom Customer Churn Dataset
->Features include:
1.) Demographics (Gender, Senior Citizen)
2.) Account Information (Tenure, Contract Type)
3.) Services (Internet Type, Add-ons)
4.) Payment Details
5.) Churn Status

📈 Key Insights (Percentage-Based Analysis)

1️⃣ Contract Type Impact

-> 42% churn rate for Month-to-Month contracts
-> 11% churn rate for One-Year contracts
-> 3% churn rate for Two-Year contracts
🔎 Customers with short-term contracts are significantly more likely to churn.

2️⃣ Payment Method Impact

-> 45% churn among Electronic Check users
-> ~15–18% churn among Credit Card & Bank Transfer users
🔎 Electronic check users churn nearly 3x more than credit card users.

3️⃣ Tenure Analysis

-> 50% churn within the first year
-> 35% churn between 1–3 years
-> 15% churn after 3+ years
🔎 Early customer engagement is critical for retention.

4️⃣ Internet Service Type

-> Fiber Optic users: 30% churn
-> DSL users: 20% churn
🔎 Fiber customers show relatively higher churn risk.

5️⃣ Senior Citizen Analysis

-> Senior Citizens: 41% churn
-> Non-Seniors: 26% churn
🔎 Senior customers require targeted retention strategies.
